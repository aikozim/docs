## Setup your project workspace

Learn how to set up your project planning environment locally and collaborate with your team.

### Setup and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your project repository">
    Start by cloning your project repository locally. This will give you access to 
    all project documentation, plans, and resources. You can find your repository 
    on your project dashboard. To clone the repository locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview your project plan">
    Previewing helps you make sure your project documentation and plans look as intended. 
    We use a local development server to render these changes. 
    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    project plan locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your project (where
    `docs.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
    <Note>
      If you're currently using the legacy ```mint.json``` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      ```npm i -g mintlify@latest```
      And run the new upgrade command in your project repository:

      ```mintlify upgrade```
      You should now be using the new ```docs.json``` configuration file. Feel free to delete the ```mint.json``` file from your repository.
    </Note>

### Deploy your updates

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your project site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your project site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your project through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
